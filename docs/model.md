# Model

The proposed model consists of a _generator G_ and a _discriminator D_. The
generator takes as input a random vector _z_ drawn from a prior distribution
_p<sub>z</sub>_ and generate a fake sample _G_(_z_). The discriminator takes as
input either a real sample drawn from the data distribution or a fake sample
generated by the generator and outputs a scalar indicating the genuineness of
that sample.

The training of a GAN can be formulated as a two-player game: the discriminator
aims to tell the fake data from the real ones, while the generator aims to fool
the discriminator.

In order to handle binary data, we propose to use [binary neurons](neurons),
either deterministic or stochastic ones, at the output layer (i.e., the final
layer) of the generator. We employ the
[sigmoid-adjusted straight-through estimators](neurons) to estimate the
gradients for binary neurons and train the whole network by end-to-end
backpropagation.

Here is the system diagram for the proposed model implemented by multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs)
